# Outer-Kerbin
KPS Planet Pack. An expansion of the Kerbin SOI.

Have you completely explored Kerbin?
Have you mined Minmus and the Mun?
But going to Eve or Duna isn't your kind of game?

Than "Outer Kerbin" might be what you are looking for!

By adding several new bodies to the Kerbin SOI, you get to explore more, close to home. 

<b> DeltaV readme for a succesfull Phybi Return </b>
<i> dV numbers based on a test i have done from lower kerbin orbit </i>

<b>Estimated Delta V for a succesfull trip</b>
- Total dV needed from LKO to Phybi Surface = <b>2520 m/s</b>
- Total dV needed from Phybi Surface to Kerbin Re-Entry = <b>980 m/s</b>
- Total dV needed for a return trip from LKO to Phybi Surface to Kerbin Re-Entry = <b>3500 m/s</b>

<b> WORK IN PROGRESS. MORE CONTENT MIGHT BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE</b>
