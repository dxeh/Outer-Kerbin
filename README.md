# Outer-Kerbin
KPS Planet Pack. An expansion of the Kerbin SOI.

Have you completely explored Kerbin?
Have you mined Minmus and the Mun?
But going to Eve or Duna isn't your kind of game?

Than "Outer Kerbin" might be what you are looking for!

By adding several new bodies to the Kerbin SOI, you get to explore more, close to home. 

<b> WORK IN PROGRESS. MORE CONTENT MIGHT BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE</b>
